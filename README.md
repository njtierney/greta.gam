## greta.gam

#### Generalised additive models in greta using mgcv.

`greta.gam` lets you use [mgcv](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=mgcv)'s smoother functions and formula syntax to define smooth terms for use in a [`greta`](https://greta-stats.org/) model.
You can then define your own likelihood to complete the model, and fit it by MCMC.

This is work in progress and is not yet ready for use!

More details and examples will follow.
